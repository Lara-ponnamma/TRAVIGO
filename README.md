# TRAVIGO

Problem Statement:
Efficient record-keeping for passenger details and travel prices is essential for streamlined bus service management. This project focuses on utilizing MySQL to create a Travego schema with two tablesâ€”Passenger and Price. The objective is to not only insert sample data into these tables but also execute a series of SQL queries. These queries involve retrieving information about female passengers traveling a specific distance, filtering passengers based on travel criteria, calculating ticket prices, and performing various data manipulations.

Objective:
The primary goals include schema and table creation, initial data insertion, and executing diverse SQL queries. The queries range from identifying specific passenger groups to altering and deleting entries, providing a comprehensive understanding of MySQL functionality in a practical context.

Conclusion:
Through this project, there's a hands-on exploration of SQL commands in managing passenger data and pricing for bus travel. The application of MySQL Workbench facilitates schema creation, data insertion, and a variety of data retrieval and manipulation tasks. This project serves as a practical exercise in database management, enhancing skills in SQL for real-world scenarios in the transportation sector.
